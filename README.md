# Sorting Visualizer

## Description

Sorting Visualizer is an application that allows users to run and visualize several sorting algorithms.  I was always fascinated with sorting algorithms, and as I was preparing for my technical interviews and refining my knowledge in data structures and algorithms, I thought it would be beneficial to build a react application out of it. During implementation, I learned the intricacies of sorting algorithms and the reasons why selective algorithms run in more efficient time and space.

## Features

* Visualize sorting animations of insertion sort, bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort, heap sort
* Control speed of sorting algorithm animations
* Control array size for which sorting algorithms will be run against


## Front End Technologies and Architecture

Frontend was built with React. Highlights of the frontend architecture include the following:

* User Interface designed with Material UI 
* Redux for state management

## Installation and Usage

Prerequisites: Install Node.js and the npm command line interface using either a Node version manager or a Node installer.

1. Fork and clone the repository
2. cd into the main folder directory
3. To install for the first time: `npm install` 
4. To start the application: `npm start`
